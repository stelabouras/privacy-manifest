Privacy Manifest CLI tool parses an Xcode project/workspace or a Swift Package
and attempts to locate calls to Apple's required reason APIs [^1] and detect
privacy collected data frameworks [^2].

The tool detects and parses the source files of the project as well as the
frameworks added in the Xcode project's Build Phase or in the Swift Package
dependencies. It also detects any frameworks / static libraries and checks if
they are included in the third-party SDK list that Apple has provided [^3].

The tool does not perform any sort of analysis beyond the simple
line-by-line check for the existence of the method calls or symbols that
Apple has already published.

The tool uses a concurrent queue to speed up the parsing process.

## Installation

You can either use the tool by typing: `swift run privacy-manifest` in the root
directory of the project, or you can install the executable to `/usr/local/bin`
directory so that you can call it from any folder.

Check out the project and run the following command in the project root 
to install the binary to `/usr/local/bin`.

```sh
sudo make install
```


## Usage

After installing the tool to the `/usr/local/bin` directory, you can invoke it
from any directory using the following command:

```
privacy-manifest analyze --project path/to/project --reveal-occurrences --output path
```

The `path/to/project` can be a relative or an absolute path to the `.xcodeproj`
or `Package.swift` file of your project.

The `--reveal-occurrences` is an optional flag that displays extended information
regarding the occurrences of the required reason APIs / privacy collected data
frameworks in your codebase, highlighting the file and the line where a call has
been detected.

The `--output` flag is optional and if specified, a `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`
property list file will be generated to that directory based on the detected
required reason APIs and from the responses of the user.

## Example

Below is the console output from the [VLC iOS OSS](https://github.com/videolan/vlc-ios).

## Future implementations

The tool can output the occurrences report to HTML for better readability.

On top of that, the list of third-party crash frameworks can be updated so that
it can inform the user when such framework is detected (there is a related TODO
in the code).

## Disclaimer

Do not use this tool alone to create your privacy manifest file for your app or
SDK. You must always double-check the occurrences that the tool displays as the
tool does not know whether a certain occurrence is included in a comment or on
an unused piece of code. Furthermore, there might also be cases where something
has not been included in the parsing process.

This tool gives you a high-level overview of the different required reason APIs
and privacy collected data frameworks your project, workspace or package uses,
so always do your own research after using this tool, to confirm the findings.
